By default, MongoDB stores its data files in ``/var/lib/mongodb`` and its
log files in ``/var/log/mongodb``, and runs using the ``mongodb``
account. You can specify alternative log and data directories using in
the MongoDB instance's :manual:`configuration file
</reference/configuration-options>`. This tutorial uses the default
data and log file paths.
